# Our Application: hAIndle
**hAIndle** is a revolutionary application that translates American Sign Language (ASL) to text and speech to text, 
bridging the gaps in communication between persons with disabilities and their peers. We aim to enable such individuals to better 
communicate and connect with their peers, in hopes that they would feel more included in their communities.

## How we can make a difference
With our Mobile Application, persons with disabilities would be able to translate their ASL to text
in real time, allowing them to communicate with their peers who may not be well versed with ASL. With our Web 
Application, the same individuals would be able to translate their ASL to text and send it virtually over their
browser. Their peers can then use our speech to text feature to communicate back to them. 

Persons with disabilities who once found it challenging to communicate with their peers can now do so through 
**hAIndle**, enabling them to better connect with them, forming more meaningful relationships with their community.

## Future developments
Our current AI model detects individual letters in ASL, and translates it into text. We would hope to expand our model 
to be able to accept British Sign Language (BSL) and be able to translate full words to text. At the same time, we 
would hope to increase the reliability of our model, improving its accuracy. 

We also hope to integrate our application into more mainstream web services such as Zoom Meetings, to better empower 
persons with disabilities.
